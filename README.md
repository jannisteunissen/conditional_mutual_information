# Mutual information

Python routines to compute (conditional) mutual information

## Overview

Both [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) and
[conditional mutual
information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_mutual_information) can
be computed for continuous variables, using a nearest-neighbor algorithm. The
implementation is based on the related methods available in
[scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org/), implemented by Nikolay Mayorov.
